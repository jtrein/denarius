> Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, and the browser and network (when available). They are intended to (amongst other things) enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercepting network requests and taking appropriate action based on whether the network is available and updated assets reside on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs. - MDN

<sub><sup>Given the poor UX of this README it may appear the late Emperor Commodus said the above about Service Workers, they were a bit before his time. He was cleverer than silly code; he was EMPEROR!</sup></sub>
